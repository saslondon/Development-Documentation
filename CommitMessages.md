Commit Comment Guide
=========================

####A collection of thoughts to improve our SVN commenting 

Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug." Don't forget to precise what you do "Fix", "Add" or "Remove".  
I.E. :

Remove: Extra dummy image.  
Fix: Header CSS issue for IE7.  
Add: Comments on doSomething().  

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
