Development Documentation
=========================

####A collection of documents used to guide a project

The aim of this respository is to house a collection of files that can be added and expanded to assist in producing the best possible end result for our clients. 

#####The initial project is the Deployment Process.

The aim of this process is to ensure, given the time constraints of a large number of projects we work on, that the final deliverable to the client is of the highest possible quality. 
With this in mind here are the initial two task lists for each new build.
